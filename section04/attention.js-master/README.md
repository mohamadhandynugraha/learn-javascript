## Install

Install attention.js is quit easy.

### Install script

Just include the script `dist/attention.js` into your project and put the script before the closing body tag.
You also need to put the css into your project `dist/attention.css`.

``` html
<html>
    <head>
        <link href="dist/attention.css" rel="stylesheet">
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="dist/attention.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>

```


## Components

### Alert

``` javascript

    import { Alert } from 'attention';

    new Alert({
        title: 'This is a Title',
        content: 'This is my content'
    });

```

### Confirm

``` javascript

    import { Confirm } from 'attention';

    new Confirm({
        title: 'This is a Confirm',
        content: 'This is my content',
        onAccept(component) {
            console.log('Accepted');
        },
        onCancel(component) {
            console.log('Canceled');
        }
    });

```

### Prompt

``` javascript

    import { Prompt } from 'attention';

    new Prompt({
        title: 'This is a Prompt',
        content: 'This is my content',
        onSubmit(component, value) {
            console.log(`Value: ${value}`
        }
    });

```
